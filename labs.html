                <p>An invaluable resource in conducting research is the laboratory. Three different laboratories allow researches to focus on a variety of topics simultaneously. Students in both graduate and undergraduate programs at Penn State conduct experiments and perform maintenance at the Building Environmental Simulation and Testing Facility. For further details on the laboratories and their capabilities, please read below.</p>

        <h2>The Building Environment Simulation and Testing Facility (BEST)</h2>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-6">
                <p>The Building Environment Simulation and Testing Facility is a state of the art installation that is part of the Mechanical Building Systems Laboratory. The facility is used for education and research and is designed for full scale thermal and air quality research. It consists of an environmental and a climatic chamber each with its own HVAC system. Another important aspect of the facility is its sophisticated measuring and data acquisition systems that are used to ascertain the energy consumption, air quality, and thermal comfort of different HVAC systems both in the facility as well as on the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Building Environment Simulation and Testing Facility was built in 2003 by funding from Penn State University and equipment donations from the HVAC industry. It is located on the University Park Campus in the basement of Engineering Unit A to provide convenience to students and researchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This facility has been designed for maximum flexibility to encourage a wide variety of research and testing programs. Both the HVAC systems and the control systems are reconfigurable such that components, subsystems or even complete systems may be easily installed modified and tested.</p>
