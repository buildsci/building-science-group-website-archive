                            <p>CITY-EN is a network assembled to pursue fundamental research and innovation in urban energy sustainability. The network brings together 21 investigators from 7 universities, with interdisciplinary expertise in climate/city modeling, renewable energy, building systems, power systems, energy economics, energy storage, system dynamics, public health, urban planning, sociology, public policy, education, and natural resources/ecology. These investigators will pursue the interdisciplinary and potentially transformative vision of future urban energy infrastructures that 1) employ energy generation, storage, and management assets to address energy sustainability as a portfolio optimization problem and 2) are capable of anticipating and adapting to the changing urban environment over multiple spatio-temporal scales. The proposed research will focus on urban energy sustainability as a key application challenge, but the underlying research framework is truly interdisciplinary and will take into account coupled challenges in the transportation/water infrastructures.</p>

                    <h1>Environmental Chamber</h1>
                    <p>The Cluster for Sustaniability in the Built Environemnt at the University of Maryland (CITY@UMD) plans to build environmental and climate chambers to study different ventilation strategies, indoor thermal comfort, and indoor/outdoor building science validation studies.</p>
                    <h2>Specifications</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Overall Chamber Dimension:</strong> The dimension of the chamber (length × width × height) is 22ft × 16ft × 15ft (6.7m × 4.9m × 4.6m). </li>
                        <li><strong>Climate Chamber:</strong> The Climate Chamber compartment occupies 30% of the chamber and has dimension of 6.6ft × 16ft × 15ft (2.0m × 4.9m × 4.6m). </li>
                        <li><strong>The Environmental Chamber:</strong> The Environmental Chamber is 15.4ft × 16ft × 15ft (4.7m × 4.9m × 4.6m) and occupies 70% of the chamber.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location of the Chambers:</strong> The chambers are located in a warehouse condition area and the ground level of the space is used for the installation of the sensors and the mezzanine is used for the installation of the HVAC systems. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Air Handling Units (AHUs):</strong> Each of the chamber compartments has separate AHUs that supplied the filtered and conditioned air, meaning at the same time the chambers can have different temperature setpoints.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Air Change Hour (ACH):</strong> The airflow rate for the chamber is 1 ACH to 12 ACH. Also, it is required for the both of the chambers to operate with 0 – 100% of the outdoor air and meet the requirements of the indoor air temperature and humidity under the outdoor design conditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Air Leakage:</strong> Max AHU leakage should be less than 5% of the flow supplied to the chamber at any time. The current need is 2-10 Pa to make sure that there is no infiltration to the chamber conditioned spaces. </li>
                        <li><strong>Setpoint Response Time:</strong> The maximum allowable response time for achieving a new set point and humidity is 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design Conditions:</strong> The design conditions to size the HVAC systems for the chamber are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Summer design conditions: T= 95°F (35°C) and RH = 60 % </li>
                                <li>Winter design conditions: T = 19.4°F (-7°C) and RH = 60 %</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Operating Condition:</strong> The temperature and relative humidity inside of the chamber needs to vary between the lower and upper range specified in the following when the chamber uses 100% outdoor:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Minimum temperature and relative humidity of the chamber are 68°F (20°C) and 40%, respectively.</li>
                                <li>The maximum temperature and relative humidity of the chamber are 82.4°F (28°C) and 70%, respectively. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Loads:</strong> The maximum internal load of the chamber consists of 6 persons, 6 personal computers/laptops, lamps, measurement equipment. This will not exceed 2 kW.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h3>ENST 681: Advanced Ecological Design <small>(Instructor: Stephanie Lansing, offered every other Spring)</small></h3>
                        <p>This is an advanced survey course on the field of ecological design and engineering. Principles of ecological engineering are applied through design of biologically-based waste treatment systems.</p>
                        <h3>ENST 689J: Valuing Ecosystem Services <small>(Instructor: Bob Tjaden, offered Fall)</small></h3>
                        <p>This course discusses the importance of our ecosystems and the services they provide. Forestland, wetlands and our marine resources are increasingly recognized for their ecosystem services provided to society, to include clean air and water, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, carbon storage and pollination services. This course will prepare students to deal with the complex issues involved in understanding those and other ecosystem services and their importance to society and environmental sustainability.</p>
                        <h3>ENST 643: Advanced Industrial Ecology <small>(Instructor: Patrick Kangas, offered Spring)</small></h3>
                        <p>Problems of waste management and recycling in human societies are covered. The industrial ecology approach to design is contrasted with analogous patterns and processes from natural ecosystems.</p>
                        <h3>ENST 653: Watershed Science: Water Balance, Open Channel Flow, and Near Surface Hydrology <small>(Instructor: TBD, offered Spring)</small></h3>
                        <h3>ENST 652: Wetland Creation and Restoration <small>(Instructor: A Baldwin)</small></h3>
                        <p>Design, construction, and evaluation of wetlands restored or created for ecosystem enhancement or mitigation. Topics will include ecological restoration theory, goal-setting, practices for establishing wetland hydrology, substrate, and vegetation, and restored ecosystem monitoring and functional assessment.</p>
                        <h3>ENST 605: Energy and the Environment <small>(Instructor: David Tilley, offered Spring)</small></h3>
                        <p>Role of energy in environmental and human-dominated systems and their linkage. Discussion of the historical and modern production and consumption of energy. Energy systems simulation modeling, energy analysis and energy auditing. Review of national energy policies and proposed alternatives.</p>
