              <p>The Building Science Group presented Virtual PULSE, a newly developed urban scale modeling platform, at the <a href="http://www.ibpsancc.org/">International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) National Capital Chapter (NCC) meeting</a>. The Virtual PULSE development team appreciates attendees for their valuable feedback. What we learned: </p>

            <div class="col-xs-12">
              <ul>
                <li>The tool can be useful for early stage conceptual design of buildings where there is a need to assess impacts of building shape and location. Virtual PULSE empowers architects, engineers, urban planners who do not plan to create detailed models in the early stage design of buildings to quickly assess different scenarios. These groups could push the tool usage forward more than other building stakeholders.
                </li>
                <li>The quick geometry and templating is useful for existing energy auditing approaches that use simple building energy models to supplement on-site data collection efforts. The models, supplemented with on-site data and judicious use of templates or benchmarking data, can give a rough consumption breakout to suggest energy efficiency measures with needing expensive sub-metering, extensive investigation, or complete building data. </li>
                <li>
                  Mechanical designers are considering non-forced air systems, e.g. chilled beans, which requires more HVAC system options. If the tool is to extend to the later stages of HVAC design, it needs to have specific thermal zoning rather than simply core/perimeter zoning.
                </li>
                <li>The quickness of model construction makes it attractive as a way for campus facility managers or government agencies to benchmark and investigate their building portfolio. At the city scale, different ownership makes this less useful. </li>
                <li>Currently the tool generates OpenStudio models, but doesn’t allow a user to upload a modified model after changes. This interoperability needs to be present to make VirtualPulse useful in tracking building performance and investigating energy efficiency opportunities. </li>

          <p> Quesadilla incorporates historic data from 1949, projected data to 2040, and includes energy flows from energy extraction method through to sector end-use, where available. This gives users an understanding of how energy is used in the U.S., and how this changes over time. It is intended as an improvement over the frequently used static <a href="https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/">LLNL Estimated Energy Use Flowcharts</a>, which do not show trends or end-uses. The data for the project is freely available from the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>. Full sources are listed in the <a href="https://github.com/mdahlhausen/quesadilla/blob/gh-pages/Quesadilla%20Data.xlsx">'Quesadilla Data.xlsx' spreadsheet</a> on our Github Page. We did our best to smooth trends where data are not directly comparable, and appreciate any input on ways to better explain to users where such smoothing is necessary. All code is under the MIT license, so anyone is free to share, modify, or use without restriction.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>For 2014 the NSF was looking for research networks looking into urban sustainability.</p>
          <p>The proposed CITY-EN research network brings together over 20 investigators from 7 universities, with interdisciplinary expertise in climate/city modeling, renewable energy, building systems, power systems, energy economics, energy storage, system dynamics, public health, urban planning, sociology, public policy, education, and natural resources/ecology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The proposed research will focus on urban energy sustainability as a key application challenge, but the underlying research framework is truly interdisciplinary and will take into account coupled challenges in the transportation/water infrastructures.</p>
          <p>The CITY-EN project is still in the proposal review phases of the National Science Foundation.
