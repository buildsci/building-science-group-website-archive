                    <h2>Graduate Certificate</h2>
                    <p>A graduate certificate in Sustainability for the Built Environment will be launched in Fall 2014 at the University of Maryland. We plan to have three certificate programs with the same topic of Sustainability for the Built Environment residing in the A. James Clark School of Engineering, School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation as well as the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The three certificate programs will merge into one professional Masters Program in 2015.</p>
                    <p>The following courses will be available to students interested in this program within the School of Engineering:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ENME808i / ENME424 “Urban Microclimate and Energy” (Instructor: Srebric)</li>
                        <li>ENME 808P/489M “Ultra-low Energy Use Appliance Design” (Instructor: Hwang)</li>
                        <li>ENME 808W “Advanced Energy Audit and Conservation” (Instructor: Ohadi)</li>
                        <li>ENME 701 “Sustainable Energy Conservation and the Environment” (Instructor: Radermacher)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These courses reflect the distinct scales that engineering students can address the sustainability issues. The first course looks at rethinking the function and capabilities of appliances that represent one of the major energy consumers in buildings. The second course investigates how a building as an integrated system can be optimized for much more efficient operation. The third course evaluates how clusters of buildings can affect each other to provide neighborhood scale sustainable solutions. Finally, the fourth course examines how renewable energy can be introduced to deal with energy demand. We are currently working with our collaborators in the School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation and the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources to outline the additional certificate courses.</p>
