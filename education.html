        <p class="tab-align">A graduate certificate in Sustainability for the Built Environment will be launched in Fall 2014 /Spring 2015 at the University of Maryland. We plan to have three certificate programs with the same topic of Sustainability for the Built Environment to be residing in A. James Clark School of Engineering, School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation as well as the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. There three certificate programs will be merge in one professional Masters Program in Fall 2015.</p>

Particular attention is paid to the environmental impact of the various forms of energy.</p>
                    <h3>ENME 808W/ENME 489N: Advanced Energy Audit and Conservation <small>(Instructor: Neil Schulman)</small></h3>
                    <p>Students will be provided with current and future trends in energy resources and technologies while providing them with the necessary skills to conduct energy audit/analysis on both commercial and residential facilities. Energy accounting procedures for electrical, mechanical and HVAC systems will be covered in detail, along with economics/life-cycle costing analysis.</p>
                    <h3>ENME 808P/489M: Ultra-low Energy Use Appliance Design <small>(Instructor: Neil Schulman)</small></h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal of the course is to drive energy efficiency innovation in appliances and equipment used in and around U.S. buildings. To achieve this goal, the course will address and discuss in detail on the psychrometric processes, vapor compression cycles, appliances and heat exchanger designs. Students will gain a thorough understanding of the potentials of these emerging technologies and experience various aspects of research and development in engineering.</p>
                    <h3>ENCE 604: Sustainability for Project Managers <small>(Instructor: Neil Schulman)</small></h3>
                    <p>
                        This course addresses the fundamentals of sustainability for project managers including best practices of modern sustainable construction and project management. Commercial and residential buildings consume about 40 percent of the energy used in the United States. The course therefore emphasizes the application of the sustainable development standards to the built environment, including the practical operational aspects of sustainable facility project management.</p>
